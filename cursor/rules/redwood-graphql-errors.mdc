 # Redwood GraphQL Error Types

When throwing errors in Redwood GraphQL services, use the specialized error types from `@redwoodjs/graphql-server` rather than generic JavaScript `Error` objects. This ensures errors are properly formatted and passed through to the frontend even in production environments.

## Guidelines

1. **Import the appropriate error type**:
   ```typescript
   import { UserInputError, ValidationError, AuthenticationError, ForbiddenError } from '@redwoodjs/graphql-server'
   ```

2. **Choose the most specific error type for the situation**:
   * `UserInputError`: For errors caused by invalid user input that can be fixed by the user changing their input
   * `ValidationError`: Similar to UserInputError but specifically for form/data validation failures
   * `AuthenticationError`: When a user isn't logged in but needs to be
   * `ForbiddenError`: When a user is logged in but doesn't have the required permissions
   * `ResolverError`: For general resolver errors that should be shown to the user

3. **Include descriptive error messages that are safe to show to users** - avoid exposing sensitive implementation details

## Examples

✅ **Good:**

```typescript
// For invalid user input
if (rows.length < 3 || columns.length < 2) {
  throw new UserInputError(
    `Not enough strike prices available to create vertical spreads. ` +
    `Need at least 3 strikes between spot price (${spotPrice}) and target price (${targetPrice}).`
  )
}

// For authentication issues
if (!context.currentUser) {
  throw new AuthenticationError('You must be logged in to perform this action')
}

// For permission issues
if (!context.currentUser?.roles?.includes('admin')) {
  throw new ForbiddenError('Only admins can perform this action')
}

// For validation issues
if (!isValidEmail(email)) {
  throw new ValidationError('Please provide a valid email address')
}
```

❌ **Bad:**

```typescript
// Generic errors get sanitized in production
if (rows.length < 3) {
  throw new Error('Not enough data') // Will show as "Something went wrong" in production
}

// Exposing implementation details
if (!user) {
  throw new Error(`Failed to query user table: ${db.errorCode}`) // Exposes internals
}
```

## Why This Matters

1. **Error messages reach the frontend**: Unlike generic `Error` objects which get sanitized to "Something went wrong" in production, these specialized errors preserve their messages.

2. **Better user experience**: Users see actionable error messages rather than generic failures.

3. **Consistent error handling**: The frontend can handle different error types appropriately based on their nature.

4. **Security**: Properly categorized errors help ensure sensitive information isn't accidentally exposed.

## Implementation

These error types work with Redwood's built-in frontend error handling in cells and forms. For example, in a cell's `Failure` component, you can extract the specific error message:

```tsx
export const Failure = ({ error }) => {
  // This will show the detailed message in both development and production
  return <div className="error-message">{error.message}</div>
}
```
