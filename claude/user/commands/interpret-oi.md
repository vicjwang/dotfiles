Interpret this chart of open interest (OI) and volume around various option
strike prices. Explain what this means for price action given likely market maker (MM) positions.

The current price is denoted in a red vertical dotted line.
Rest of the color scheme:
- Call OI: white
- Call Volume: light grey
- Put OI: black
- Put Volume: dark grey

IMPORTANT: Remember that MMs are likely short gamma which means they buy into rallies and
sell into dips when current price is out of the money. Hedging activity is reduced when
strikes are in the money.

Generally, this means that out of the money strikes with high OI act as
a magnet for the underlying price.

Think hard.
