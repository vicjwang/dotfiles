description: Retrospective analysis of coding session - insights, patterns, and improvements
---

Retrospect on our coding session. Keep it brief and actionable.

## What Worked (1-2 bullets max)
What patterns or approaches should we keep doing?

## What to Improve
- What specific issues slowed us down or caused problems?
- What would have accelerated progress?
- What process discipline broke down?

For each issue, propose a concrete fix.

## Proposed File Edits

Based on this session's learnings, propose specific edits to slash commands or agent files.

**For each proposed change:**
1. Identify the file (e.g., `~/.claude/commands/finish-job.md`)
2. Explain what to change and why
3. Show the specific edit (old → new)
4. Wait for user approval before applying

**Common targets:**
- Slash commands: `~/.claude/commands/*.md`
- Agent configs: `~/.claude/agents/*.md`
- Global instructions: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Project instructions: `./CLAUDE.md`
