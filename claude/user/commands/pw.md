# Playwright Web Automation

Use the Playwright MCP tools to perform web automation tasks. The user will provide:
- A URL to navigate to

## Instructions
1. Perform the requested actions using the appropriate Playwright tools
2. Provide feedback on the results
3. Take screenshots or snapshots as needed to show the current state

Use browser_navigate to visit the URL, browser_snapshot to see the page structure, and other browser_* tools to interact with the page.
